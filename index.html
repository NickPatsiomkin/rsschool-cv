<h2>About myself</h2>
<br>
<p>My name is Nick. I'm 20 years old. I live in Minsk, Belarus. I'm in the 4th year of the <strong>Faculty of Law</strong> of BSU.
    After studying in Belarus for lawyer job, i suddenly realized that my future job will be complicated because of the overpopulated job market.
    I decided to change my qualification and chose to study Software engineering. I think that it's very popular modern job.
    I really think that this job will suit me because of my personality.</p>
<p>I'm open-minded and arrogant. Working in team is not a problem for me, because I can communicate well with all types of people.</p>
