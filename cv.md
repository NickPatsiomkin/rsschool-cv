## About Myself ##
My name is Nick. I'm 20 years old. I live in Minsk, Belarus. I'm in the 4th year of the Faculty of Law of bsu.

After studying in Belarus for lawyer job, i suddenly realized that my future job will be complicated because of the overpopulated job market. I decided to change my qualification and chose to study Software engineering. I think that it's very popular modern job. I really think that this job will suit me because of mt personality. I'm open-minded and arrogant. Working in team is not a problem for me, because I can communicate well with all types of people. I really believe, that my abitily to learn and communicative skills will help me to gain enough skills to become a good Frontend developer.

I met programming in school, also I was visiting some computer science courses at school.Today I'm studying in Rolling Scopes School.

I'm sure that my knowledges and personal skills will be enough to get this job.
